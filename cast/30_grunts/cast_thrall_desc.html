			<p class="info">The basic overview of the project. Sell me on the idea in as few a words as possible.</p>
			<p><tag>{Game: the Verbing Noun}</tag> is a single player action adventure game set in {FamousSetting}. The game takes the visceral action of games such as {Some Action Game}, mixes it with style switching from games such as {Some Other Action Game}, and finishes it with {buzzword} from modern games such as {Popular Franchise}. All of this is mixed with both world class art and tech to create a game that is as brutal as it is beautiful.</p>

		Thrall

		[pic]
		Note: the description document lays out the high level look and feel of a cast member. I chose the Thrall for two reasons: first, being humanoid, it makes him both easy and hard to describe as everyone “knows” what a human looks like, so you have to overcome their biases; and second, he has several sub-types, so I wanted to show that, at least for this document, that does not matter. You are mostly selling the LOOK not the FUNCTION, so the fact that you have several sub types does not matter, and going into all that kind of minute detail will muddy the clear message of what they should look like.
		Look at it this way, if you have trouble fitting the visual descriptions of two sub types into this document, then you do not have a new subtype, you have a new type all together. Remember: if something is functionally distinct, then it should be visually distinct, unless your intent is to confuse the player (it’s not, is it?)
		This uses a lot of categories and headers. Here are their definitions and purposes.
		Class - The class to which this belongs (grunt, captain, generals, etc)
		Visual Look - Define the look of the AI, armor, accessories, size, etc…
		Gender - Male or Female or something else altogether
		Stance or Posture - How the AI presents itself, dominant, passive, or whatever
		Navigation Mode - How the AI locomotion works
		Functionality - a very brief explanation of how they function.
		Equipment - Weapon explanation and function
		Effects - Kind of effects the AI uses, fire, electrical, aura, etc…
		Sound - Kind of sounds the AI makes from taunts to reactions to attack.
		Reference - Pictures, movies, comic books, etc..

		Background

		Thralls are humans who have become slaves to the Fae. Prolonged enslaved and interaction with the Fae realm, especially to the more powerful denizens, has a twisting effect on both the mind and the body. Most thralls, therefore, are no more than shells, bent fully to the will of whatever Fae got their claws into them. The ones that are not driven mad, given enough time, begin to change and become more like Summer or Winter, depending on which side they were bent.
		Visual Look

		Thralls are not zombies, and they are not the undead, but they will share a lot in common visually. They are men, alive, but they are savage to the point of disarray, and their minds are so destroyed that they no longer feel pain, which leaves most of them with bloody festering wounds. They have gaunt faces, ripped clothing, and miss-matched armor. These humans are nothing more than guard dogs to the Fae, and they are treated as such. They are fed scraps and kept feral.
		The longer a human stays ensorcelled by a Fae the more they begin to take on the attributes of their specific house. Winter Thralls, for example, will be covered in frost, and their eyes will turn blue.
		Stance - Posture

		Hunched and very aggressive. These humans are almost feral in nature, driven mad by the Fae.
		Movement

		They lope everywhere they go, and they can never sit still. Even when standing idle, they are in constant pain, as their minds have been crushed. They act like a mental patient that is hearing voices (that’s because they are).
		Equipment

		They are clothed and equipped like barbarians, but their equipment changes slightly based on their sub type. Thralls are broken into three equipment types: standard, archer, and handler.
		Standard

		Fur armor. Rusty sword and a small buckler.
		Archer

		Similar armor to the standard versions, but carrying a bow with arrows.
		Handler

		Leather armor instead of fur armor, and instead of a buckler they carry two swords. One in each hand.
		Effects

		Thralls have two major subtypes when it comes to effects: normals thralls, and winter thralls. Winter thralls have spent more time with the Fae, and have been twisted by them far more than other thralls. Consequently, they are shrouded in a thin layer of frost, and their eyes burn brightly blue.
		All winter style enemies have a similar effect, known as Winter Armor, which is the same across the entire game. If the player attacks something with Winter Armor and attempts a highly damaging attack, enemies with Winter Armor will react by being completely covered in a hard shell of ice, which protects them from all subsequent attacks. Think Iceman.

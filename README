The game may be fake, but the documentation is real. This is a reasonable facsimile of how I approach the task of designing a game's many layers of documentation. From the large to the small; from the general to the specific; from the programmers to the animators; from the word documents to the excel files.

These files: their names, their style, their organization, their content, their intent, it is all shared with you freely.

This is meant to be a conversation about documentation; a conversation and not a sermon, mind you, as the latter does not involve you the reader, and that is not my intent. This is the form and structure of how _I_ do things, but it does not and should not necessarily be how _you_ do things. Every game is different, and every _genre_ of game is different. My hope is that this structure and some its ideas, maybe a lot the ideas, will be enlightening; but I also hope that some of it will not and, in fact, you will look at it and say that it can be done better; that you have seen it done better. I hope that you will join the conversation and share how it was done better. In this way, and only in this way, will the game designers of the world truly grow.

Thanks.
